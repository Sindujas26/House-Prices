# House-Prices

This project analyzes the Housing dataset to predict house prices using advanced regression techniques. The analysis includes comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) with examination of 81 features including 38 numerical and 43 categorical variables. Key preprocessing steps involve handling missing values, applying log transformations to reduce skewness in highly skewed variables (MiscVal, PoolArea, LotArea, etc.), and analyzing correlation patterns between features and sale prices. The project demonstrates data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization techniques using Python libraries including pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib. Through detailed statistical analysis and visual exploration, the project identifies key factors influencing house prices such as OverallQual, GrLivArea, and neighborhood characteristics.
